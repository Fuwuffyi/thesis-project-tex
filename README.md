# ThesisProjectTex

This document accompanies my bachelor’s thesis, which explores the design and implementation of a real-time
graphics renderer built using Vulkan and OpenGL. The focus is on achieving physically based rendering (PBR) and
deferred shading, demonstrated through the Sponza scene.

The renderer’s full source code are available in a separate repository:
